# What went Well

    I was able to quickly figure out how to break the main goal/design into different components.

    I was able to get most of the functionality correct.

    I liked that this was a practical assessment of job-relevant skills.

    I liked the design of the slider in the navbar, it's something I haven't seen often.

# What I learned

    slider package - Discovered this after I couldn't quite get a manual slider to work.

    Importance of responsive design.

    How useful the srcset & <picture> element combination are.

# What I can improve

    Develop my responsive design knowledge.

    Do not spend too long trying to re-invent the wheel, if a package exists, don't feel bad for 
    having to use it.

    Fix the strange thing that happens when you click on the 3rd slider picture
